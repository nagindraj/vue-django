Still to write ansible script to automate the deployment of frontend and backend applications.

Follow the steps to start the application:

1) Provided the centos minimal with ssh, sshd and docker.
2) Build the dockerfile in the nginx folder.
3) Build the Dockerfile-python-setup in the backend folder.
